In this folder you'll find code for the R package ZIDM found in:

“A Bayesian Zero-Inflated Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression Model for Multivariate Compositional Count Data” by Matt Koslovsky

The main functions operate in C++ via the R package Rcpp. These functions can be sourced by a set of wrapper functions that enable easy implementation of the code in the R environment. Various functions are available that produce and summarize the results for inference.  

This package relies on various R packages that need to be installed in the R environment before running. To install, use the install.packages(‘’) command for the following packages:
Rcpp 
RcppArmadillo  
MCMCpack
mvtnorm 
ggplot2
devtools  

Then to install the ZIDM package, simply run 

library(devtools)
install_github( "mkoslovsky/ZIDM" )

in the R console or install directly from the source code in Supplementary Material.
